# Introduction

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that allows us to track changes to files over time. It helps us see the entire history of a project, undo changes, and collaborate on the same files with others without causing conflicts. This ensures that all changes are well-documented, making it easier to identify and fix errors.

## Use Cases
We use version control for several reasons:
- **Collaborating on code projects**: Multiple developers can work on a project simultaneously without blocking each other. Each developer works on their own copy, and changes can be merged later.
- **Tracking changes**: Every change is logged, allowing us to see who changed what and when. This makes debugging and tracing errors much easier.
- **Branching**: Git enables the creation of different branches to develop new features or fix bugs without affecting the main code. This allows multiple developers to work on different aspects of a project in parallel.

## Why Git?
Git has several key advantages over other version control systems:
- **Free and Open-Source**: Git is free and open-source, meaning anyone can use and modify it to fit their needs. There are no licensing fees, and a large community continuously improves the tool.
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Git is a distributed version control system. Every developer has a complete copy of the entire repository, meaning they can work offline and save changes locally.
- **Industry Standard**: Git is the industry standard and is supported by all major code hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
- **Performance and Flexibility**: Git is extremely fast and efficiently handles large codebases. It also offers advanced workflows like rebasing, cherry-picking, and complex branching strategies.

# Installing Git

Before you can use Git, you need to install it on your computer.

Here are the installation instructions for the most common operating systems.

## Windows

On Windows, you can install Git using the official installer:

1. **Download the Git Installer:**  
   Go to the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/win), and the download should start automatically.

2. **Run the Installer:**  
   Open the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the installation wizard. You can keep the default options unless you need specific customizations.

3. **Verify the Installation:**  
   After installation, you can verify Git by opening the **Git Bash** terminal (installed along with Git) and running the following command:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

## Mac

On macOS, you can install Git using the Homebrew package manager:

1. **Open a Terminal**  
   Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal," and press Enter.

2. **Install Homebrew**  
   Run the following command in the terminal to install Homebrew:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
3. **Install Git with Homebrew**  
   ```bash
   brew install git
   ```
4. **Verify the Installation**  
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   If installed correctly, you should see the Git version in the terminal, e.g., `git version 2.34.1`.

## Linux

1. **Install Git using your distribution's package manager:**
   - **Ubuntu/Mint/Debian-based systems**
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install git
     ```
   - **Arch-based systems**
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S git
     ```
   - **Fedora/RedHat-based systems**
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install git
     ```
2. **Verify the Installation**
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   If installed correctly, you should see the Git version in the terminal, e.g., `git version 2.34.1`.
